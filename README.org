* SamrayBlog
  SamrayBlog is a clear-design blog system implements with vue.js and spring boot.And this repo
  is the frontend code of SamrayBlog.Before ,because i am keep looking for a blog 
  system that is suitable for my workflow,i have try hexo and jekyll,but i am not
  satisfied  with these blog system.So i decide to write it by myself.Vue is 
  so popular,and i have learned it for a while,i decide to use it in my project.

   this is the demo of my upcoming blog system,but i have stopped to develop
   my blog,because,after 2-month development,i have finish almost 70% code.
   And finaly ,i find the perfectly suitable blog system for me :[[https://github.com/kelvinh/org-page][org-page]]  
   which is a static site generator based on Emacs and org mode.I am an Emacser.
   The typical Emacser is who wanna do everything in his/her Emacs,so do i.
   Thus,i stop my job.But 2-month work still is worth to say something
   Plus:I am not a frontend guy
